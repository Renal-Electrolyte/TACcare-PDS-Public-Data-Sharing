| Study Design | Secondary analysis of EMA baseline data collected as part of the Technology-Assisted stepped Collaborative Care (TACcare) trial |
| Study Intervention | Technology Assisted stepped Collaborative Care (TACcare) Technology Assisted Health Education Attention Control |
| Follow-up Duration (per participant) | baseline, 12weeks post intervention and 6 months |
| Background | Patients with kidney failure have a high symptom burden, and many report an acute exacerbation of symptoms immediately after in-center hemodialysis. Very few studies have used ecological momentary assessment to examine posthemodialysis patient-centered outcomes. |
| Methods | Participants in the Technology-Assisted Collaborative Care trial completed an automated telephone-administered Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale at four time points daily for 7 consecutive days. The Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale yields four symptom domain scores: Positive Mood, Negative Mood, Alert Cognition, and Sleepiness/Fatigue. Posthemodialysis symptom domains and item-level scores were compared with similar time points on nonhemodialysis days using linear mixed models analyses. Mixed models were also used to explore the association of postdialysis symptom burden with demographic, psychosocial, hemodialysis treatment, and disease-specific characteristics. All analyses were adjusted for age, race, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. |
| Results | One hundred and fifty-six hemodialysis patients with available ecological momentary assessment data were evaluated (mean age=58±14 years, 55% men, 51% White). In the posthemodialysis period, patients reported significantly lower Positive Mood (mean difference [MD]=−0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.29 to −0.14) and Alert Cognition (MD=−0.13; 95% CI, −0.18 to −0.08) and higher Negative Mood (MD=0.12; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.19) and Sleepiness/Fatigue (MD=0.51; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.61) compared with nonhemodialysis days. The mean postdialysis symptom exacerbation total score was 0.70±1.21, representing an increase of 6% of the maximum scale range. In the postdialysis period, relative to nondialysis days, the mean decrease in Positive Mood and Alert Cognition scores equaled 4% and 2% of the maximum scale range, respectively; the mean increase in Negative Mood and Sleepiness/Fatigue scores equaled 2% and 9% of the maximum scale range, respectively. |
| Conclusions | Patients with kidney failure reported worsening of both fatigue and mood symptoms posthemodialysis. |
