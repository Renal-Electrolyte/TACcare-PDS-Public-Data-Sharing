|Study Design|Parallel arm randomized controlled trial|
|Study Intervention|Technology Assisted stepped Collaborative Care (TACcare) Technology Assisted Health Education Attention Control |
|Follow-up Duration (per participant) |baseline, 12weeks post intervention and 6 months|
|Background|Patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) have a high symptom burden and many report an acute exacerbation of symptoms immediately following in center hemodialysis (HD). Very few studies have used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine post-HD patient-centered outcomes.|
|Methods|Participants in the Technology Assisted Collaborative Care (TĀCcare) trial completed an automated telephone-administered Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS) at 4 timepoints daily for 7 consecutive days. The DISS yields 4 symptom domain scores: Positive mood, negative mood, alert cognition, and sleepiness/fatigue. Post-HD symptom domains and item-level scores were compared to similar timepoints on non-HD days using linear mixed models analyses. Mixed models were also used to explore the association of increased post-dialysis symptom burden with demographic, psychosocial, hemodialysis treatment, and disease-specific characteristics. All analyses adjusted for age, race, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.|
|Results|56 HD patients with available EMA data were evaluated [mean age=58±14 years, 55% men, 51% White]. In the post-HD period, patients reported significantly lower positive mood [mean difference (MD)= -0.22, 95% CI (-0.29, -0.14)] and alert cognition [MD= -0.13, 95% CI (-0.18, -0.08)] and higher negative mood [MD=0.12, 95% CI (0.05, 0.19)] and sleepiness/fatigue [MD=0.51, 95% CI (0.42, 0.61)] compared to non-HD days.|
|Conclusions|Patients with ESKD reported worsening of both fatigue and mood symptoms post- HD. As such, we recommend use of the term “post-dialysis syndrome.”|
